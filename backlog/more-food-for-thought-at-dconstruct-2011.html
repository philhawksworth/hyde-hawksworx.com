    Once again this year, I travelled to Brighton on the south coast of England recently to attend what has become a highlight in my conference attending calendar. While not being the conference which yields the most practical output for me, <a href="http://2011.dconstruct.org" title="dconstruct 2011">dConstruct</a> is always thought provoking.

    This year was no exception. As with any event, I enjoyed some session more than others, but the standard was certainly high throughout.  <a href="http://jnd.org/" title="Don Norman's jnd.org / user advocacy and human-centered design">Don Norman</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0385267746" title="The Design of Everyday Things: Amazon.co.uk: Donald A. Norman">The Design of Everyday Things</a> fame, opened the conference with a pleasing if not ground-breaking talk which included some interesting insights into the impact and value and politics of patents and intellectual property.

    The morning continued with talks from Kelly Goto, who was excellent, but sadly had to rush through the second half of here talk in order to squeeze in all her content, <a href="http://2011.dconstruct.org/conference/bryan-stephanie-rieger" title="Bryan Rieger &mdash; dConstruct 2011">Bryan and Stephanie Rieger</a>, whose <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/yiibu/letting-go-9109114?from=ss_embed" title="Letting Go">slides</a> were stunning, but whose talk rather left me behind,
     and <a href="http://craigmod.com/" title="Craig Mod - Considering the future of books &amp; storytelling">Craig Mod</a>.  I really enjoyed Craig's talk, but have to admit to losing the thread a little as his talk moved from an interesting and entertaining presentation style "knowledge nipples, anyone?!" to something harder to stick with. About two thirds of Craig talk were of him reading a looooong passage from a book with accompanying visuals. After talking to other attendees, I found that most found this a little hard going. A shame as the rest of his talk was a highlight of the morning for me.
